 A basic media player with Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
 
 
Team #3 Music library App allows the user to add/browse songs. Some core functionalities are sorting the songs by Artist/Album, and right-click on songs to add to playlist. In order to implement this, we included a song manager and playlist manager class. We used a tag library to read in our music files, so that the user only needs to drag their music into the assets folder. The UI provides controls such as an auto-play time slider, play, pause, and etc.
